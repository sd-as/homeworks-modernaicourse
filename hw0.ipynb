Most autograding systems work by uploading your code and running it on the grading server; this ensures that your code runs independently and functions as desired, but has the notable downside that, for complex assignments, it can be difficult to ensure that the environment of the autograder is sufficiently similar to your own environment.  Countless hours have been wasted by students trying to trace the exact way in which the autograding environment differs from their own.  This is especially a problem for machine learning assignments where GPUs are required to run the code, and we know of very few systems that handle this setup in a seamless fashion.\n",

The upside is that we can support large courses with relatively little overhead.  The downside is that it does allow cheating of some type: you absolutely could compute the solutions manually for each mugrade test case and then submit those answers to get full points.  And this would almost certainly be more time-consuming than just solving the problem to begin with.  So in a world where most assignments can be solved by AI anyway, it seems a very reasonable trade-off to give a bit more control to students of their coding environment, at the cost of possibly introducing slightly more ability to game the system.  This is why, as a final measure, we ask for all students to upload a copy of their assignment, so TA's can check it as needed.]"
